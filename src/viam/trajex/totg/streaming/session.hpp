/// Sampling is forward-only and stateful: each call to `sample_next()` or
/// `sample_at_least()` advances an internal cursor, and how far that cursor has
/// advanced determines whether a later extend can pivot or must stage. The session
/// assumes single-threaded ownership; sampling and extending from different threads
